# Scope
This is a work in progress experimenting with TDD, kotlin and spring boot 2, spring framework 5 and other stuff that 
strikes my fancy

# TDD book
I've been reading Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests to learn how to better apply TDD for a work project. 
This project will offer some freedom to experiement with the concepts better, and to geek on some other fun stuff.  For
now I'm gonna use spcok as thats something I'm familar with, but at some point may dabble with Spek, and other kotlin
based testing frameworks

# Some other resources
Kotlin spring demo.  lots of stuff to learn here
